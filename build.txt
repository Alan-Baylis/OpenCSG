Open OpenCSG.dsw / OpenCSG.sln
Set OpenCSGexample as active project
Compile and start example

-----

1) If you do not have installed GLEW yet:
    Go to directory glew/ and type 'make'
	This will build the GLEW library in glew/lib/
    Go back into main directory
2) If you have QT-3 installed: 
    type 'qmake', then 'make'
   Else:
    Just try to type 'make'. Maybe you must adjust the Makefiles in
    the src/ and the example/ directory for sucessful compilation
3) The OpenCSG library will have been build in lib/, and the example
    "opencsgexample" will reside in the src/ directory. To run the
	opencsg example, you must ensure that the GLEW and the OpenCSG
	libs are in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH (e.G., one way to do this is to
	copy them to /usr/local/lib and running "ldconfig -v"). Currently 
	there is no automatic way for this.
