04.11.2003: Stenciling was not disabled in SCS algorithm when 
    subtracting no shapes. This could lead to obscure rendering 
    errors when rendering the next CSG shape. 

02.11.2003: Added heuristic that makes the pbuffer smaller 
    if the size of the pbuffer has been bigger than necessary in 
    x- or y- direction for a certain number of render-calles. 
    This permits to use OpenCSG for CSG rendering in different
    canvases with different sizes without constant expensive
    resizing of the pbuffer for every frame.

01.10.2003: linux: removed accidental linking against tcl/tk  

23.09.2003: release 0.9
